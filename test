Thanks for getting back to me. This is my first build i'm getting parts from 6 different country's its crazy. My part list became very specific, with my interest in ardupilot starting the misson.
Just to be clear. It is my understanding that Team Blacksheep produce:

    TBS Crossfire TX - Long Range R/C Transmitter
    TBS Crossfire TX LITE - Long Range R/C Transmitter
    TBS Crossfire Micro TX V2

Indeed the bluetooth feature for relaying telemetry into my ground station "qgroundcontrol"
